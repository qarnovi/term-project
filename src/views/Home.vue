            I am married and we have two beautiful daughters. I enjoy spending
            time with my family after work and on the weekends. I help my oldest
            dauther with her math homework from Russian School of Math (RSM) and
            attending RSM. Both of my daughters go to swimming and gymnastics
            classes and they enjoy each of the sessions.
