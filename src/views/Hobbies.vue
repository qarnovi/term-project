                The Piano is a wonderful instrument that enhances any type of
                music it is used with. It is so versatile that it has the
                ability to fit into a variety of music contexts, whether as a
                solo instrument or as an accompaniment. The piano is a lovely
                instrument to compose and to practice on, and helps you become
                skilled in musical notation. For those who already know to play
                other musical instruments, the piano simply lets you enjoy and
                build on your musical talent even more.
