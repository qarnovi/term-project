It is so versatile that it has the ability to fit into a variety of music contexts, whether as a solo instrument or as an accompaniment. The piano is a lovely instrument to compose and to practice on, and helps you become skilled in musical notation. For those who already know to play other musical instruments, the piano simply lets you enjoy and build on your musical talent even more. </p></blockquote><figcaption> From <cite><a href="https://www.discoverahobby.com/piano-keyboard" target="_blank">discoverahobby.com</a></cite></figcaption></figure></td></tr></table><h3>Playing guitar</h3><table><tr><td><picture><img src="'+s.a+'" alt="guitar"></picture></td><td><figure><blockquote><p> Learning a new art is always very exciting and satisfying as well. So if you are a music buff and have always thought of learning how to play a musical instrument, do it right away. Learning an instrument like the guitar will require a little patience but it will have its rewards in the long run. It can be the perfect accompaniment if you are a singer, or it can bring you one step closer to that rock-star fantasy that you`ve nurtured since you were a child. It can be the perfect way to calm you down when you`re in a bad mood. Composing your own tunes can also give you a different high altogether. And then of course, if you think you are a star, you can always make big money with your new found guitar skills and entertain the whole world. </p></blockquote><figcaption> From <cite><a href="https://www.discoverahobby.com/guitar" target="_blank">discoverahobby.com</a></cite></figcaption></figure></td></tr></table></section>',2);function u(t,e){return c}a("a951");var l=a("6b0d"),h=a.n(l);const d={},p=h()(d,[["render",u]]);e["default"]=p},"60c8":function(t,e,a){},"8ab0":function(t,e,a){t.exports=a.p+"img/guitar.e79777ff.jpg"},"8d59":function(t,e,a){t.exports=a.p+"img/piano_480.7cb1527a.jpg"},a951:function(t,e,a){"use strict";a("60c8")}}]);
